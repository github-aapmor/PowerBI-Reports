## Analysis Process:
After importing the dataset with the help of Power Query, I performed data **cleansing**, data **wrangling**, data **modification**, data **transformation**, data **manipulation**, and data modeling as per the requirements to draw appropriate conclusions. I achieved this by using calculated **measures**, calculated columns, and **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**. Additionally, I **created relationships** between tables by utilizing primary keys and foreign keys. For visualization, I used various charts and value cards for **KPI presentation(Key Performance Indicator).**

In this analysis process, I have included a total of 119 constituencies. I've used three separate dashboard pages for displaying the data visualizations for the **2014** and **2018** elections. In another dashboard, I compared both datasets, showing constituency-wise votes, vote share, along with party-wise votes and vote share percentages for better clarity. This allowed me to identify the leading party with a significant vote share percentage within each constituency and by party.
