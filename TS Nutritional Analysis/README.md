# Telangana Nutrition Analysis

This Dashboard about Telangana Nutrition Analysis (Dept. Of Women and Child Welfare), we having Data from year 2019(From Jan) to 2023 (till Sep).


## **Source of Data**:

We obtained our data from the Telangana Open Data Portal, where we downloaded the dataset(.Csv Format) titled “**Telangana Women and Child Development - Nutritional Status of Children in Anganwadi centres**”. 

This dataset contains information on the

**Reporting Year**, 
**Report Month**,

**Tot_Stunting_Normal**, 
**Total_Stunting_MAM**,
**Total_Stunting_SAM** of children who attend Anganwadi centres in Telangana, which are rural child care facilities that provide nutrition, health services.

### Analysis Process:

Importing data with the help of Power Query using using Folder then merging data and performing cleaning, data modification, data transformation, data manipulation, and Data Modeling as per the requirements to draw appropriate conclusions. Additionally, We created relationships between tables by utilizing primary keys and foreign keys. For visualization, We used various charts and value cards for KPI presentation(Key Performance Indicator).

The data show the weight status of children in **2.03** **Million** Anganwadi centres in **33** districts of Telangana State, based on the categories of underweight, stunted, and wasted. Each category is further classified into normal, moderate, and severe subcategories.

The **Bar chart** compares the top five districts in Telangana by their weight category (underweight, stunted, and wasted), based on the number of children in normal condition. 

The chart shows that Rangareddy district has the highest number of children in normal condition for all three weight categories: **4.9** **million** for stunting, **4.7** **million** for underweight, and **4.9** **million** for wasting.

The **second highest** district is **Medchal-Malkajgiri**, with **4.6 million** children in normal condition for stunting and wasting, and **4.4 million** for underweight.

The **third highest** district is **Hyderabad**, with **3.8 million** children in normal condition for underweight and wasting, and **3.6 million** for stunting.

The **fourth highest** district is **Nizamabad**, with **3.8 million** children in normal condition for stunting and underweight, and **4 million** for wasting. 

The **fifth highest** district is **Sangareddy**, with **3.8 million** children in normal condition for wasting, **3.4 million** for underweight, and **3.8 million** for stunting.
