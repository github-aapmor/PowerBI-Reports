## **Analysis Process**:
 
After importing the dataset with the help of Power Query, We performed data cleansing, data modification, data transformation, data manipulation, and Data Modeling as per the requirements to draw appropriate conclusions. We achieved this by using calculated measures, calculated columns, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). Additionally, We created relationships between tables by utilizing primary keys and foreign keys. For visualization, We used various charts and value cards for KPI presentation(Key Performance Indicator).

**In the Left hand side we have Updated some filter slicer so as per Date Hirarchy, Department, Position,Employee Category, Manager we can filter the data which is available on all the pages.**




We created a column chart to analyze the number of employees as per age group, based on the dashboard that shows the data of **90** employees from **7** departments and **3** employee categories.


We created a pie chart to show the wholesome percentage department-wise distribution of employees, with **sales** having the largest share of **54.44%**, followed by marketing with **18.89%**, **IT** with **10**%, **HR** with **8.89%**, and **accounts** with **6.67%**.

We created a line area chart to analyze the number of employees working according to their experience level, ranging from fresher to 10 years. The chart shows that the highest number of employees have 7 years of experience (14), followed by 5 years (13) and 8 years (10). The lowest number of employees have 10 years of experience (2), followed by 9 years (6) and 3 years (3). The rest of the employees have 1 year (6), 2 years (4), or no experience (8).

 
We created a pie chart to show the gender-wise distribution of employees, with **male** having largest share **62.22%**,**Female** have **37.78%**
